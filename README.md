# Assignment_Decision_Tree-Heart_disease-
The objective of this assignment is to apply Decision Tree Classification to a given dataset, analyse the performance of the model, and interpret the results.
### Decision Tree

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. The decision tree structure consists of nodes representing decisions or test conditions, branches representing the outcome of these tests, and leaf nodes representing the final decision or classification.

### Types of Decision Trees

1. **Classification Trees (CART)**
   - **Purpose:** Used to classify a set of data into predefined classes.
   - **Output:** Categorical values (e.g., Yes/No, True/False).
   - **Example Algorithm:** Classification and Regression Tree (CART).

2. **Regression Trees**
   - **Purpose:** Used to predict continuous values.
   - **Output:** Numerical values (e.g., predicting house prices).
   - **Example Algorithm:** Regression Tree.

3. **Decision Stump**
   - **Purpose:** A simple decision tree with only one decision node.
   - **Output:** Used for very basic decisions or as weak learners in ensemble methods like AdaBoost.
   
4. **Random Forests**
   - **Purpose:** An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions.
   - **Output:** Aggregated results from multiple decision trees to make a final decision or prediction.

5. **Gradient Boosted Trees**
   - **Purpose:** Another ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous one.
   - **Output:** Typically used for both classification and regression, offering high performance on complex datasets.

### When to Use Decision Trees

- **Classification Problems:** When you need to classify data into different categories based on input features.
- **Regression Problems:** When you need to predict a continuous outcome based on input features.
- **When Interpretability is Important:** Decision trees provide a clear visualization of the decision-making process, which is easy to interpret and understand.
- **Handling Non-linear Relationships:** Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Feature Selection:** Decision trees can implicitly perform feature selection by choosing the most important features to split on.

### Advantages of Decision Trees

1. **Simple to Understand and Interpret:** Decision trees are easy to visualize and interpret, making them useful for communicating results to stakeholders.
2. **No Need for Feature Scaling:** Decision trees do not require normalization or standardization of data.
3. **Handles Both Numerical and Categorical Data:** Decision trees can work with both types of data, making them versatile.
4. **Handles Non-linear Relationships:** Decision trees can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features.
5. **Robust to Outliers:** Decision trees are relatively robust to outliers compared to other algorithms like linear regression.

### Disadvantages of Decision Trees

1. **Overfitting:** Decision trees can easily overfit the training data, especially if the tree is very deep. Pruning or using ensemble methods like random forests can mitigate this.
2. **Unstable:** Small changes in the data can result in a completely different tree being generated. Ensemble methods can help reduce this instability.
3. **Bias towards Features with More Levels:** Decision trees can be biased towards features with more levels or unique values.
4. **Not Suitable for Large Datasets:** For very large datasets, decision trees can become slow and computationally expensive to train.
5. **Greedy Nature:** Decision trees make decisions based on local optima at each node, which may not lead to the best overall tree structure.
